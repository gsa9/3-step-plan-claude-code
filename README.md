# 3-step-plan-claude-code

Decide → Plan → Execute skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Each step produces a lightweight artifact so you can `/clear` context and start the next step fresh — better performance, lower token cost (see [Hotkeys](#hotkeys) to automate this).

- **Step 1** — structured Q&A where Claude challenges your assumptions, pushes back on risky choices, and discovers new questions as your answers reshape the problem. Writes `_step1_decisions.md`
- **Step 2** — reads the decisions file in a fresh window, transforms them into parallelism-maximized phases with dependencies, guardrails, and file-level context. Writes `_step2_plan.md`
- **Step 3** — reads the plan file in a fresh window, dispatches phases to subagents while the main context stays lean

I run Claude Code with `bypassPermissions` mode enabled, which skips all permission prompts and lets Claude work autonomously. **Use with caution:** this setting allows Claude to modify files and execute commands without approval. This repo intentionally excludes `settings.json` to avoid overwriting your existing configuration. If you want to enable bypass mode, add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"
  }
}
```
For a less aggressive option, use `"acceptEdits"` instead — it auto-approves file edits but still prompts for other operations. See the [Hooks](#hooks) section below for a custom statusline you may also want to add.

## Overview

Three skills, numbered steps: **1 → 2 → 3** (Decide → Plan → Execute).

```
/step1 (decide) → _step1_decisions.md
    ↓ fresh session
/step2 (plan)   → _step2_plan.md → deletes _step1_decisions.md
    ↓ fresh session
/step3 (execute) → code changes → deletes _step2_plan.md
```

`/step1` guides you from open question to clear decision through structured one-at-a-time Q&A — Claude asks, recommends, auto-decides when obvious, discovers new questions as answers reshape the picture, and tracks all decisions as you go. For multi-file or convention-setting outcomes it writes `_step1_decisions.md` — the artifact that bridges analysis to planning. Only for single-file localized fixes does it skip the artifact and proceed directly. `/step2` reads `_step1_decisions.md` in a fresh session and transforms those decisions into a parallelism-maximized `_step2_plan.md` with per-phase guardrails, rich Reference fields for subagent orientation, and a validation checklist before writing. `/step3` executes it via subagents in a fresh session. Each stage produces a disposable artifact consumed and deleted by the next. Code changes are the deliverable, not the artifacts.

Also included: `/trim` for token-efficient documentation condensing, and `/gc` for streamlined git commit and push with a Python helper for compact diff summarization.

## Why Custom Plan Skills?

Claude Code has a [built-in Plan Mode](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that I also use. These custom skills are an alternative I reach for when I want my own control over multi-phase plans — exploring options and pitfalls with `/step1` before committing, then creating structured plans with `/step2` that break work into self-contained phases for parallel execution.

### Why /step1, /step2, /step3?

The names follow a natural progression: **step 1** decide, **step 2** plan, **step 3** execute. Numbered commands are intuitive — the pipeline reads naturally as `/step1 → /step2 → /step3`, and the order is self-documenting. No ambiguity about what comes next.

### The Fresh Session Pattern

Each skill produces an artifact that carries context forward, so you start each stage with a clean context window. `/step1` writes `_step1_decisions.md`, then you start a fresh session for `/step2`. `/step2` reads `_step1_decisions.md`, writes `_step2_plan.md`, and deletes `_step1_decisions.md`. Then you start a fresh session for `/step3`.

**Recommended flow:**
```
/step1 → _step1_decisions.md → fresh session → /step2 → _step2_plan.md → fresh session → /step3
```

## Compatibility

Claude Code uses a bash shell on all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows via Git Bash). Skills use only POSIX-compatible commands (`date`, `rm`, etc.) — no platform-specific dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
cp -r skills/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or cherry-pick specific files into your existing config. All five skills will be available as slash commands.

## Skills

Custom slash commands invoked with `/<skill-name>`.

### Planning Workflow

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/step1` | Decide: explore, interrogate (structured Q&A), bridge to decision |
| `/step2` | Plan: design structured phases with full context for fresh-session execution |
| `/step3` | Execute: run via parallel subagents, delete plan on success |

**Iterative by Design**

Software development is iterative — you discover what you need day by day, not upfront. This workflow preserves that rhythm: smaller plans with controlled execution, letting you advance confidently while maintaining the ability to course-correct when a step proves wrong.

**Flow:** `/step1` → explore options, surface pitfalls, converge on ONE direction → `_step1_decisions.md` → fresh session → `/step2` → structured `_step2_plan.md` with rationale → fresh session → `/step3` → subagents execute → plan deleted

  [1] During /step1        → Answer questions one at a time, go back if needed
  [2] After _step2_plan.md → Review phases, adjust before execution
  [3] During /step3        → Monitor progress, fail-fast resets to checkpoint

  WHY THREE STEPS?
  ────────────────
  • /step1 thinks WITH you — Claude asks, recommends, you decide one at a time
  • /step2 captures everything in _step2_plan.md — the sole context bridge
  • /step3 runs fresh — subagents get isolated context, main thread stays lean

  TOKEN LIFECYCLE

  /step1 writes _step1_decisions.md → fresh session for /step2
  /step2 reads _step1_decisions.md, writes _step2_plan.md, deletes _step1_decisions.md
  Fresh session for /step3 (_step2_plan.md carries everything forward)
  On success: _step2_plan.md deleted (code is the deliverable)

<summary><strong>Why This Approach Works</strong></summary>

Since ChatGPT's public release on November 30, 2022, through the transition to Claude Code with Opus on the Max plan, one pattern has proven reliable: tight feedback loops with human judgment at decision points. This workflow gives you end-to-end execution from idea to completion while keeping you in control of pace and direction.

**Related tools:** I was already using multi-phase planning skills when I discovered [GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done). What caught my attention was GSD's use of subagents to preserve the main context window. I incorporated that pattern into my workflow, refining `/step3` so the orchestrator stays minimal while subagents handle the heavy lifting.

Interestingly, Claude Code's built-in Plan Mode uses similar tactics — we're all converging on the same insight: **delegate context consumption to isolated agents**.

GSD does more than I need for my workflow. `/step1`, `/step2`, and `/step3` take a lighter approach for developers who prefer tighter feedback loops — scanning first, refining plans conversationally, steering direction as needed. More elaborate plans consume more of your usage allowance, which matters on Claude Code's Max plan where token efficiency is important.

**Features:** Phases with dependencies · Parallel groups · Git checkpoint with all-or-nothing execution · Per-phase Reference and Guardrails · Auto commit & push on success · Subagent orchestration · Token-efficient artifact lifecycle · Context window management

---

**Why analyze first?** `/step1` isn't just analysis — it's structured interrogation where Claude drives the conversation one question at a time, dynamically discovering new questions as each answer reshapes the problem space. It explores the codebase, forms opinions, probes for weaknesses in your chosen approach, and flags tensions between decisions. When the evidence is overwhelming, it auto-decides and moves on. You see a running decision tracker after every answer, and can go back to revisit any previous choice. The output is a compact decision block — with rejected alternatives and risks clearly stated — that `/step2` actively transforms into parallelism-maximized phases with per-phase guardrails.

In Claude Code, you can use skills in two ways:
- **Start of conversation** — Begin with just `/step1` to open an interactive session, bouncing ideas back and forth until direction crystallizes
- **Anywhere in a prompt** — Include `/step1` at the end or mid-prompt to get structured analysis before committing to implementation

---

### /step1 — Explore, Interrogate, Decide

Interactive Q&A that converges on decisions. Reads your codebase, identifies decision points, and walks through them one question at a time.

- Auto-decides when codebase evidence is overwhelming
- Pushes back on risky choices
- Discovers new questions as answers reshape the problem
- Tracks decisions with a live status block after every answer

**Output:** `_step1_decisions.md` at repo root (or inline summary for single-file fixes via early resolution).

**Usage:**
- `/step1` — asks what needs solving
- `/step1 <topic>` — skips the opening question
- `/step1 resume` — continues from last decision tracker

### /step2 — Structured Plan for Subagent Execution

Reads `_step1_decisions.md` and produces a self-contained execution plan. Designed so a fresh `/step3` session can execute it with zero prior context.

- Transforms decisions into phases with explicit file paths, guardrails, and dependencies
- Maximizes parallelism — groups independent phases for concurrent execution
- Keeps each phase within a context budget (~50-150 lines) so subagents stay focused
- Validates before writing: parallel maximization, no file collisions, subagent autonomy, guardrail placement, completeness

**Output:** `_step2_plan.md` at repo root. Deletes `_step1_decisions.md` after writing.

**Usage:**
- `/step2` — reads `_step1_decisions.md` automatically
- `/step2 <goal>` — falls back to description if no decisions file exists

**Execution model note:** `/step3` targets 50-150 lines per subagent dispatch. `/step2` designs phases to fit this budget — if a phase needs extensive context to execute, it's too big or too vague and gets split.

### /step3 — Execute Plan via Subagents

Dispatches phases from `_step2_plan.md` to subagents. The main thread is a lightweight orchestrator — it never executes tasks directly.

- Creates a git checkpoint before any work begins
- Runs parallel groups concurrently, serial groups in order
- Fail-fast: stops on first failure, recommends checkpoint reset
- On success: deletes `_step2_plan.md`, commits and pushes

**Execution model:** All-or-nothing. A git checkpoint is created before any phase runs. If anything fails, reset to the checkpoint — no partial recovery, no resume.

**Usage:**
- `/step3` — loads and executes `_step2_plan.md`

### /trim — Token-Efficient File Optimization

Documentation and instruction files tend to grow over time. Every conversation, Claude reads these files for context. That accumulated verbosity costs tokens without adding value. `/trim` condenses prose without losing a single piece of information. It inventories every fact, rule, and example before making changes, then verifies nothing was lost. When in doubt, it keeps the original.

Use `/trim` as periodic maintenance on any documentation that evolves with your project. The result: cleaner files, lower token overhead, same complete information.

**Usage:**
- `/trim <file-path>`

### /gc — Git Commit and Push

A streamlined git commit and push workflow. `/gc` stages all changes, generates a commit message from a compact diff summary (via `gc_diff.py`, a Python helper that parses `git diff --staged -U0` into per-file stats), and pushes. It never reads files or runs expensive git commands to inform the message — only the script output and conversation memory.

`gc_diff.py` uses only Python stdlib — no dependencies required.

**Usage:**
- `/gc` — auto-generates message from diff
- `/gc <message>` — uses provided message
- `/gc --repo <path>` — targets a different repository

  _step2_plan.md IS THE CONTEXT BRIDGE
  ─────────────────────────────
  Everything a fresh /step3 session needs is IN the plan:
  ✓ Rationale    - approach, patterns to follow, what's out of scope
  ✓ Phases       - self-contained, no cross-phase references
  ✓ Reference    - files to read + what to look at in them
  ✓ Guardrails   - per-phase constraints from analysis pitfalls
  ✓ File paths   - explicit, never "the file from Phase 2"

  PARALLELISM-FIRST DESIGN
  ────────────────────────
  1. Identify work units (every file/module change)
  2. Group by independence (separate files = parallel)
  3. Form parallel groups FIRST
  4. Serialize only what must be serial
  5. Split to unlock more parallelism

  VALIDATION (before writing)
  ──────────────────────────
  ✓ Could any dep be broken by splitting?
  ✓ No file collisions in parallel groups?
  ✓ Subagent autonomous + dispatch under ~150 lines?
  ✓ All pitfalls placed as guardrails?
  ✓ All decisions reflected in phases?

  CONTEXT BUDGET
  ──────────────
  Target 50-150 lines per subagent dispatch
  If a phase exceeds this, split it

# Migrate to New API

**Goal:** Replace legacy REST client with new versioned API across client and server.
**Created:** 2026-02-15

## Rationale

**Approach:** Incremental migration — new types first, then client/server in parallel
**Why:** Existing code already uses typed responses; adding new types is non-breaking
**Patterns:** All types use Response<T> wrapper; endpoints follow RESTful naming in src/routes/
**Non-goals:** No SSO integration, no breaking changes to public API surface

## Phases Overview

| Phase | Name | Depends | Parallel Group | Est. Lines |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | Create types | - | A | ~60 |
| 2 | Update client | 1 | B | ~80 |
| 3 | Update server | 1 | B | ~75 |
| 4 | Integration tests | 2,3 | C | ~50 |

## Phase 1: Create types
**Modifies:** src/types/
**Reference:**
- `src/types/api.ts` — follow existing Response<T> wrapper pattern
- `src/types/index.ts` — add re-exports here
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define new API response types
- [ ] Add validation schemas
```

## Artifact Lifecycle

```
/step1 → _step1_decisions.md written
    ↓ (fresh session)
/step2 → reads _step1_decisions.md → writes _step2_plan.md → deletes _step1_decisions.md
    ↓ (fresh session)
/step3 → checkpoint → executes → deletes _step2_plan.md (or reset to checkpoint on failure)
```

Both `_step1_decisions.md` and `_step2_plan.md` are disposable. Each step produces an artifact, the next consumes and deletes it. The code changes are the deliverable, not the artifacts.

**Location rules:** All plan artifacts live at repository root — never in subdirectories.

## Context Efficiency

The three-step pipeline is designed around context window limits:

1. **Fresh sessions** — each step starts clean, avoiding context bloat from prior exploration
2. **Artifacts as bridges** — `_step1_decisions.md` and `_step2_plan.md` carry only what the next step needs
3. **Parallel subagents** — `/step3` dispatches small, focused phases that fit within subagent context budgets (~50-150 lines per dispatch)
4. **No accumulated state** — the orchestrator in `/step3` tracks only phase numbers and status, not content
5. **Rationale propagation** — the Rationale section in `_step2_plan.md` gives subagents awareness of the "why" and pitfalls without the orchestrator having to relay context from the analysis session

**Fast execution:** With permissions pre-approved, execution is fast and — when you're confident — can run unsupervised to completion.

**Fully autonomous:** Enable `bypassPermissionsModeAccepted` in settings or run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to skip all permission prompts (use with caution — try at your own risk).

## Hotkeys

### Quick-Access Hotkeys (Windows)

For frequent use, keyboard shortcuts eliminate typing skill names entirely. The included [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script binds skills and utilities to hotkeys when Windows Terminal is focused.

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| <kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> | Type `/step1 ` (stays editable — add context before submitting) |
| <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd> | Clear context, then send `/step2` + Enter |
| <kbd>Ctrl+3</kbd> | Clear context, then send `/step3` + Enter |
| <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> | Send `/gc` + Enter |
| <kbd>Ctrl+M</kbd> | Send `/clear` + Enter |

**Why clear is built into <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+3</kbd>:** `/step2` and `/step3` are designed for fresh sessions — they read their input from artifact files (`_step1_decisions.md`, `_step2_plan.md`), not from conversation history. Running them in a stale context wastes tokens and risks confusing the model with leftover state. The `ClearAndCmd` function folds clear+invoke into one keypress. `/step1` and `/gc` don't auto-clear because they benefit from existing context — `/step1` often follows a conversation, and `/gc` commits what you just worked on.

**The workflow cycle:**

```
Ctrl+1  →  add context, submit  →  /step1 runs, writes _step1_decisions.md
Ctrl+2  →  /clear clears context, /step2 reads _step1_decisions.md, writes _step2_plan.md
Ctrl+3  →  /clear clears context, /step3 executes plan
```

One keypress per stage — no manual clearing between steps.

**Setup:**

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (v2.0+)
2. Create a shortcut to `hotkeys/3step-hotkeys.ahk` and place it in your Startup folder so it runs on login:
   - Right-click the `.ahk` file → **Create shortcut**
   - Move the shortcut to your Startup folder:
     ```
     %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
     ```
     Open this folder quickly with <kbd>Win+R</kbd> → `shell:startup` → Enter.
3. Double-click the script (or restart) to activate.

**Notes:**
- **Vim mode safety:** The script starts every hotkey with <kbd>Esc</kbd> → `i` to ensure the input is in insert mode regardless of current state. This prevents keystrokes from being interpreted as vim commands when the terminal is in normal mode. If you don't use vim mode in your terminal, this is harmless.
- **Sleep timing:** `Sleep(200)` between keystrokes and `Sleep(1500)` after `/clear` + Enter ensure reliable sequencing. Claude Code needs time to process `/clear` before accepting the next command. Increase these values if keystrokes arrive before Claude Code is ready.
- **`#HotIf` scoping:** `#HotIf WinActive("ahk_exe WindowsTerminal.exe")` scopes hotkeys exclusively to Windows Terminal — they never interfere with other applications. Customize this target for other terminals (e.g., `ahk_exe Code.exe` for VS Code's integrated terminal).
- **macOS/Linux:** Similar bindings can be achieved with tools like Hammerspoon (macOS) or xdotool (Linux).

## Hooks

### Status Line

`hooks/statusline.js` displays context window usage (percentage + bar), working directory, projected quota utilization (5-hour and 7-day with time until reset), and current model:
```
━━━━━━┈┈ 12%    project     ━━━━━━┈┈ 48m    ━━┈┈┈┈┈┈ 2.8d    Opus 4.6
```
Quota data is fetched from the Anthropic OAuth usage API with a 30-second cache. Time remaining adapts units automatically: minutes under 1h, hours under 1d, days otherwise. The context bar shows used percentage after the bar graph. Filled segments use default text color, empty segments use a dotted outline. Quota bars turn orange when projected usage reaches 90%+.

**Projected usage, not current:** The quota bars show where you're heading, not where you are. The bar extrapolates current consumption rate across the full window — if you've used 20% in the first hour of a 5-hour window, it projects 100% (on pace to exhaust). A projected bar at 90% turns orange — an immediate signal to slow down.

Enable in `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node -e \"require(require('os').homedir() + '/.claude/hooks/statusline.js')\""
  }
}
```
